# Welcome to simdgo's source repository.

Many modern processors come with support for SIMD technology (single
instruction, multiple data), which allow for the same mathematical operation to
be performed on a set of numbers concurrently on a single core. simdgo library
uses x86 assembly SIMD instructions to allow you to leverage SIMD instructions
in your Go code.
